Some games that you could make in SDL2 with only squares (SDL_Rects for now, later maybe I go wild and use some SDL_points)

All the games are in only one file (plus the game file that I use to start and shutdown SDL2) because are very simple.

To play any of this games:
```
g++ -lSDL2 Game.cpp Game.hpp main.cpp
```

(unless the readme file in the folder of the game say other thing)
